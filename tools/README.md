# Tools for RASH

The tools included in this directory allows to process RASH documents in order to check its validity against the formal grammar, convert it from/to different formats, and enhance it with additional RDF statements. In this page only the "sh" scripts are described, while the tools included in the various directories, i.e., the [*ODT2RASH* converter](https://github.com/essepuntato/rash/tree/master/tools/odt2rash) (for converting OpenOffice documents into RASH) and the [*SPAR Xtractor*](https://github.com/essepuntato/rash/tree/master/tools/spar-xtractor) (for enhancing RASH documents with additional RDFa about the structure of the paper), have their proper README file.

##Â create-zip.sh

This script creates the zip package of the current distribution of RASH.

## rash-check.sh

This tool checks RASH documents against both the requirements in the RASH
specification and the full requirements in the HTML specification.

<pre>
Usage:
  rash-check.sh [-h] [-p html|xml] <FILENAME>.html
  rash-check.sh [-h] [-p html|xml] <FILENAME>.xhtml

Options:
  -h  Emit this usage statement.

  -o  json|html|xml|xhtml|text
      Output results in the format specified. [Default: gnu]

  -p  html|xml
      Force the checker to use the indicated parser. (Overrides the automatic-
      parser-selection-based-on-file-extension behavior described above).

  -w  Show warnings and info-level messages, not just errors. (By default,
      without this option specified, only error messages are shown).
</pre>

If you supply a `*.html` filename, the checker parses it with an HTML parser.
If you supply a `*.xhtml` filename or a filename with any other extension, the
checker parses it with an XML parser. Use the `-p` option to override this.

## rash-update.sh

This tool allows one to update an input RASH document compliant with an old version of the RASH grammar according to the earliest available version.

<pre>
Usage:
  rash-update.sh -s:[input RASH file] -o:[output RASH file]
</pre>
